# Exploring the Potential Impacts of Temperature and Precipitation on River Height
# Tyler Dunn

# Hypothesis:
There will be noticable patterns between river height and precipitaion and/or the temperature measured at stations contained within the rivers watershed.

# Motivation:
I chose to study the Nooksack River for it's proximity to myself as well  as because of its periodic flooding, which can have adverse effects on those living around it. 

I also looked at a second river, Cedar River that is also in Western Washington, in order to compare the data from the two. 

I hoped with this analysis to gain more of an understanding of the causes of the flucuating heights of rivers.

# Data:
All of the data was obtained from the USGS website. All the data used is contained in the CSVs folder in this project.

# Analysis Method:
Rainfall, temperature and river height were plotted on top of eachother and against eachother in order to see any patterns in the data.

I then looked at a time series and spectral analysis of 15 years of Nooksack River height data to see if there were regular patterns in high and low measurments of the river which could be explained by increases or decreases of average temperature brought on by the changing seasons.
