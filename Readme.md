# Impacts of Temperature and Precipitation on River Height
# Tyler Dunn

# Hypothesis:
There will be noticable patterns between river height and precipitaion and/or the temperature measured at stations contained within the rivers watershed.

# Motivation:
I chose to study the Nooksack River for it's proximity to myself and as well because of its periodic flooding, which can have adverse effects on those living around it.

I hoped with this analysis to gain more of a quantifiable understanding of the causes of the rivers flucuations in height.

# Data:
All of the data was obtained from the USGS website. All the data used is contained in the CSVs folder in this project.

# Analysis Method:
Rainfall, temperature and river height data were all combined into a single table with the date and time of collection for each measurment used as a key for joining them. The three values were then plotted next to eachother to look for any patterns in the shapes of the graphes. 

At this point, there was not much of a correlation found between temperature and river height. I then looked at 15 years of river height data to see if there were regular patterns in high and low measurments of the river which could be explained by increases or decreases of average temperature brought on by the changing seasons.
